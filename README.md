Doxygen_Template
================

Small template for a Doxygen documentation page.


This template contains three files:

* **Doxyfile:**

  This is the template file for the Doxygen creation with the Doxywizard. All the include paths can be defined here.

* **groups.dox:**

  In the groups file new groups for the documentation can be defined. Itâ€™s also possible to define new groups in directly in the code. With this file all de definitions are located at one place.

* **mainpage.dox:**

  In this file the main page of the documentation page is defined. This page is not autogenerated if not defined. Standard HTML code can be used to design the page.
